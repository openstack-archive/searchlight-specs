Searchlight Project Specifications
==================================

Our process is meant to allow users, developers, and operators to express
their desires for new features using Launchpad blueprints. A review of
blueprints is done regularly. These may turn directly into features with
in-tree documentation, or for complex requests, additional specifications
(“specs”) may be needed. This page captures those more complex requests.

Please read the Searchlight process documentation on feature requests and
bug reports:
